# Caesar Cipher
###### A simple implementation of the classical Caesar Cipher with a twist, it forces the user to write a message, then it forces the user to write an integer in the range 1 - 25, and then it returns the cipherized message displaced by the amount selected, writen in pure python (3.6+ required due to use of f-strings)
